    <h1>Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep Randomizer</h1>
    <h2>
      To download a seed, click the button:
      <input id="click" type="button" value="Randomize" />
    </h2>
    <h3>About the Randomizer:</h3>
    <p>
      
      <strong>Currently randomized:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Chests & Stickers</li>
        <li>Starting Weapons</li>
      </ul>
      More functionality will be added over time as this randomizer gets developed. Furthermore it's <br> 
      not guaranteed that you will be able to find everything like All Stickers etc. This will be changed <br> 
      in the future.
    </p>
    <h3>How to get started:</h3>
    <p>
      First of head to the discord (Link at the bottom) and downloaded the latest version of Sonic's Open <br>
      World lua file as well as download a seed with the button at the top, then follow either of the <br>
      two guides:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/TopazTK/LuaFrontend/releases" target="blank">LuaFrontend</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You want to download LuaFrontend and unpack the .zip folder. Take both lua files that you downloaded <br> 
      beforehand and put them into the folder <strong>scripts > bbsgl</strong>. Then launch LuaFrontend and activate both scripts. <br>
      Now you're good to go!
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Sirius902/LuaBackend/releases" target="blank">LuaBackend</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You want to download LuaBackend and unpack the .zip folder. Take DGBHELP.dll and place it in <br>
      <strong>C:\Program Files\Epic Games\KH_1.5_2.5</strong> or wherever you have KH 1.5 + 2.5 installed. <br>
      Now go to <strong>C:\Users\NAME\Documents\KINGDOM HEARTS HD 1.5+2.5 ReMIX\scripts\bbs</strong> and place both <br>
      lua files in here. If these folders don't exist yet you can go ahead and create them. Now you're good to go!
    </p>
    <p>
      Both methods work with the randomizer, though most testing has been done with LuaBackend. <br>
      Keep in mind that this randomizer is a work in progress. Bugs will be
      fixed as they appear.
    </p>
